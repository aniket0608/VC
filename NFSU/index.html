        It gives me immense pleasure to place on record that the National
        Forensic Sciences University, the upgraded Gujarat Forensic Sciences
        University has been scaling new heights since its inception as a state
        university. With the sole objective of creating experts in the field of
        Forensic sciences, the university was established by the Honâ€™ble Prime
        Minister of India Shri.Narendra Modiji, then Chief Minister of Gujarat
        in 2009. In the inaugural year, very limited number of academic courses
        were offered by the university with hundred and odd students. This
        university has come a long way to become the Central University known as
        the National Forensic Sciences University with a tag of Institution of
        National Importance. As an assertion to the phrase; there is no
        substitute for hard work, the university has made stringent efforts to
        become a globally acclaimed institution in this highly specialized area.
        It is in turn to integrate a number of centers across the country.
        Government of India has annexed a centre at New Delhi, as another campus
        of the National Forensic Sciences University which is the erstwhile
        National Institute of Criminology and Forensic Sciences. Many centers
        are to be integrated in various parts of the country and also across the
        globe. Without any sorts of precedence for such a specialized
        university, this institution has made spectacular achievements within a
        short span of eleven years. This has ultimately yielded fruitful results
        and has been bestowed with a tag of Institution of National Importance.
        The relentless efforts of this institution have been enthusiastically
        well recognized and positively acknowledged by the Government of Gujarat
        and also by the Government of India. The courses those are being offered
        in this institution are also of tailored made/ customized courses
        according to the trends prevailing in the country and the society. Every
        course that is being introduced by the university is always the much
        sought after by the employers of the respective fields. The practical
        exposure with hands on provided to the students is also of high quality
        and advanced. The association with the directorate of forensic sciences
        has yielded much value to the practical exposures for the student
        communities. Cutting edge research has always been an area of high
        impetus. Prospective researchers are emphatically motivated to come out
        with the solutions to the current issues faced by the society and also
        by the global humanity. This sort of research is not only confined to
        the core areas of forensic sciences but also in the broader disciplines
        of behavioral sciences, security studies, defense related areas. Student
        researchers are encouraged to pursue their research to find out
        solutions to the national/ social issues relating to the criminal
        investigations, physical and digital security, drugs and consumable
        products, behavioral studies etc. Exemplary contribution is being made
        by this university by involving itself in expert training and
        professional consultancy services those are being provided to various
        national and international organizations in the area of criminal
        investigation, banking / insurance sectors, and security agencies armed
        forces to mention a few. We, at the NFSU, continuously aspire to be a
        breeding ground for positive ideas and emerge as a symbol of openness of
        thoughts, cultural pluralism and celebrating the unity in the diversity
        of India. We endeavor to touch the lives of every student by inculcating
        prudence, efficiency, creativity and compassion to work for the
        betterment of the marginalized / needy sections of the society. We
        attempt to kindle their sense of responsibility, honesty, conscience,
        justice and above all commitment to human values. We intend to pursue a
        multi-stakeholder consultation approach, in which students, teachers and
        staff, as well as alumni and other stakeholders, including the media,
        play a meaningful role. We pay our respect to those who had been
        associated with the University and seek to meet their expectations to
        take the University to greater heights. It is an earnest appeal to
        everyone to join us in fostering a healthy, peaceful and enthralling
        atmosphere at the University campuses, and affiliating institutions. We
        invite you to get yourself enriched with outstanding knowledge and are a
        part of the intellectual resources /forensic science think tanks of the
        country for serving the nation in a more authentic manner. We look
        forward to welcoming you to the National Forensic Sciences University
        and to be a part of our family contemplating to achieve Vasudhaiva
        kutumbakam. "Never say no; never say I cannot, for you are infinite. All
        the power is within you and you can do anything with
        education"........Swamy Vivekananda.
